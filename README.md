# soilProblem

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning and deep learning-based solution aimed at minimizing water consumption in agriculture.
The project predicts whether a region needs water or not based on six key variables: Soil Moisture, Temperature, Soil Humidity,Air Temperature (Â°C), Wind Speed (km/h), and Air Humidity (%).
Various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and a Neural Network with two hidden layers,
were tested to make this prediction. After evaluating the models, the Random Forest algorithm provided the most accurate and effective solution for predicting water needs.
The goal of the project is to optimize water usage in agriculture by providing reliable predictions based on environmental factors.
